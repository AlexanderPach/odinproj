    <h1>The Best Baked Ziti</h1>
    <p>I am half Italian, was raised eating the finest Italian-American cuisine, and have filmed almost 2000 recipe videos, 
        so when you consider all of those facts, it seems incredible that I have never posted a video for baked ziti. Hopefully
         I make up for that long wait by posting what I think is the best version of it.</p>
     
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>8 medium cheery tomatoes </li>
        <li>1 (11 ounce) can refigerated pizza crust</li>
        <li>8 teaspoons shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>8 teaspoons finely chopped red onion</li>
        <li>Â½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>8 slices pepperoni, quartered</li>
        <li>Italian seasoning to taste</li>
        <li>red pepper flakes to taste</li>
        <li>garlic salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 8 cups of a muffin tin with cooking spray.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Finely chop cherry tomatoes and drain any liquid. Set aside.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Step 3</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Unroll pizza crust on a floured work surface and roll out thinly into a large rectangle. Using a 4-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, cut 8 circles in the dough. Place dough circles in the prepared muffin cups, pressing dough into the bottom and up the sides of each cup.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Step 4</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Drop 1 teaspoon mozzarella into each cup. Top with 1 tablespoon of pizza sauce. Add chopped tomatoes and red onions. Add 1 tablespoon of mozzarella to each cup, and top with pepperoni. Sprinkle each cup with Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, and garlic salt to taste.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <li>Step 5</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and melted, 14 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool in the tin for about 5 minutes. Remove from the tin and serve hot.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
    </ul>
